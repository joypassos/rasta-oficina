The above example depicts a solution for a web-based application that hosts anonymous
surveys that are advertised publicly on social networks; any user can participate, and no
login is required.

**Details**: 
* The client is running the solution in his garage with two Linux machines:
* The database server is running on one Linux machine.
* The application runs on a container in another Linux machine.
* The client purchased the domain topsurvey.contoso.com which he pointed to its
physical server public IP address.
* Millions of users from around the world can access this application from the internet.

**Problem**: 

The client is complaining that the machines running the workloads are under heavy load
(100%), and that most of the surveys are incomplete.

Due to the current cloud adoption trend in the sector, the client decides to hire a cloud
engineer to migrate the solution to a public cloud and hopefully fix the issues and increase
the reliability.

You are the hired cloud engineer, and you are challenged to elaborate a detailed cloud
migration strategy with all the best practices in mind.
