# Problem Statement
The project involves migrating an anonymous survey hosting application from a local environment to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). The application, built with Flask and using an Oracle database, needs to be containerized and deployed on OCI to leverage its scalability, performance, and reliability. The migration also includes setting up the necessary network infrastructure, database, and load balancing on OCI.

## Solution Summary
The migration process involves several key steps:

1. Local Setup:
* Application Code: The application is written in Python using Flask and connects to an Oracle database.
* Dockerization: The application is containerized using Docker.
* Database Initialization: SQL scripts are used to set up the initial database schema.

2. OCI Configuration:
* Network Setup: Create a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) with public and private subnets.
* Security Rules: Configure security lists to control traffic.
* Autonomous Database: Set up an Oracle Autonomous Database for scalable and managed database services.
* Kubernetes Cluster: Deploy the application using Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) for container orchestration.
* Load Balancer: Configure an OCI Load Balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances.

3. Data Migration:
* Use Oracle Data Pump to migrate data from the local database to the Oracle Autonomous Database.

4. Deployment:
* Deploy the containerized application to the OKE cluster.
* Apply Kubernetes configurations using kubectl.

5. Monitoring and Optimization:
* Use Oracle Cloud Monitoring for continuous performance tracking.
* Configure auto-scaling and backup strategies.
